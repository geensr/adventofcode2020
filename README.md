## What is this ?
This repo is just my storage for participating (on a whim) with the [AdventOfCode2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I used to a be a (reasonable good) programmer in both C and Perl but that was more than 15 years ago. During the Covid19 pandemic I found myself with more free time and started exploring how the SW development world has evolved ... has it ever.

I am learning Git (very nice) and have started a few things in Python, R and will hopefully experiment more with Javascript (or TypeScript) in the near future.

During this advent of code I don't have the intention to write excellent code and I simply want to get these (fun) assignments finished while refreshing some skills.
