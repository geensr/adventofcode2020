## What is this ?
This repo is just my storage for participating (on a whim) with the [AdventOfCode2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

During this Advent of Code 2020 I don't have the intention to write excellent code and I simply want to get these (fun) assignments finished while refreshing some skills. The aim is not to spent more than 30 minutes/day, but we will see how it goes when things get more difficult or when I do start experimenting with other programming languages.

## Who am I ?
I used to a be a programmer in both C and Perl but that was more than 15 years ago. During the Covid19 pandemic I found myself with more free time and started exploring how the SW development world has evolved ... has it ever.

## Why am I doing this ?

I am learning Git (very nice) and markdown (is this really necessary) and have started a few things in Python and R and will hopefully experiment more with Javascript (or TypeScript whatever) in the near future.
